                            <p>I graduated from UNIST in Feb. 2020 and majored in Electrical Engineering and Human factor Engineering.
                                From then on, I kept studying music BCI and speech BCI with Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocorticogram (ECoG) as a researcher in BCILAB.
                                My main research areas are neural signal processing and neural data analysis in the auditory domain, and BCI system development related to it. 
                                I became a graduate student in Sep. 2020 in UNIST and kept working on my research in BCILAB until now, and expected to graduate in Aug. 2022.

                            <p>I am a dancer from 15 and have a teaching experience in UNIST, not only for K-pop but also basic routines and genres. 
                                Although I'm not a professional dancer, I can at least teach people in person and make them enjoy dancing.
                                 If you like K-pop and dancing, I might be your best friend and a teacher for you:)

                                I taught front-end HTML/CSS building and how to design at Regent University in Accra, Ghana. The student age was from 18 to almost 40. 
                                I had grown my ability in Web design in 2015 when I was a member of Like Lion 4th.

                            <p> In BCILAB, we have a BAND!!! In the 2021 workshop, we are planning to play what we've practiced, 6 songs in total.
                                I am a lead director and a member of a violin session replacing elec guitar session.
                                I've played violin since 6, but have not been educated for a long period. Nonetheless, it's the instrument that I'm good at.
                                You might be able to check it out after the workshop on December 17th.
