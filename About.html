                            <p> In BCILAB, we have a BAND!!! In the 2021 workshop, we are planning to play what we've practiced, 6 songs in total.
                                I am a lead director and a member of a violin session replacing elec guitar session.
                                I've played violin since 6, but have not been educated for a long period. Nonetheless, it's the instrument that I'm good at.
                                You might be able to check it out after the workshop on December 17th.
