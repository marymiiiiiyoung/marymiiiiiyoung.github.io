                            <p> In BCILAB, I was a violin player in the BCIBAND! In the workshops in 2021 winter and 2022 summer, we had a band performance.
                                I was a lead director for all of the stages and a member of a violin session.
                                I've played violin since 6, although formal education was only prolonged for 4 years. Nonetheless, it is the instrument that I am good at.
                                You can check the performance in youtube.
