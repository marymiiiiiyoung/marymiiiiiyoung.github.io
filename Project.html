                                This is a BrainCoder real-time feedback system. The circle icon in the keyboard is predicting a imagined musical pitch from the EEG feature at that time. 
                                Subject is imagining a musical pitch colored in sky blue on the keyboard, with a task to locate the icon at the keyboard.
                                Also, the auditory feedback is present everytime the predictions are made(sound is not out here as subject is listening to it with earphones). This audio-visual feedback might grow the pitch sense of the subject which can be used as a training method for the amusics.
                                The feature extraction method and the journal article of it is in the peer-reviewed progress.
                                The system development method and feedback generating method will be written in article too.

                            <p> Along with Music BCI, the speech BCI for Korean is in progress. The offline data analysis of Electrocorticogram for 8 Korean words is in the preparation of writing.
                                The content of it is the relationship between the Korean words feature, semantic/phonologic, and the tasks, Covert/Overt, with ERP pattern analysis using DTW(dynamic time warping).
                                However, the final purpose is to generate imagined Korean sentence for patients who lost the linguistic communication ability.
                                Currently, I am working on the experiment of Korean words and analyzing it in chunk unit, Object and Verb.
                                The image representing the project is upcoming.

                            <p>AICP challenge is a AI project held in UNIST innovative education center. I am a memeber of team 'Cheonsang-gye' as a data analysist.
                                We are conducting a research with robot sensor data, as the smart factory work environment is becoming prevalent in aerospace and automobile industry.
                                As the prediction power of robot arm drilling process is becoming important in that condition, a novel method to predict the delamination on Carbon-fiber Reinforced plastic(CFRP) is developing, 
                                and one of the methods is to predict it with AI algorithm which is unknown yet. We are conducting data analysis and about to apply an 'multi-modal Neural Network' to the data to predict the delamination more accurate.
